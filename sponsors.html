					<h2>Sponsors</h2>
					<p>As a part of the learning experience, the team is challenged by the University to raise its own funding through corporate sponsors and donors.</p>
					<p>As Canada's premier engineering school, our exposure is second to none. Having your company's logo on our vehicle, website, and team apparel will help to generate interest in your business among graduating students and provide advertising opportunities for your organization. The Baja team relies on the generosity of its sponsors to remain liquid.</p>
					<p>Please also take a look at our Information Brochure: it provides a quick summary of what Waterloo Baja SAE is all about. If you have questions regarding sponsorship please contact us.</p>

					<h3>Promotion</h3>

					<h3>Financial</h3>
					<p>Cash donations are used to cover material costs, purchases, and competition expenses.</p>

					<h3>In-Kind</h3>
					<p>The student machine shop often does not have the capability to fabricate many of the vehicle components. In-kind sponsors donate machining technology to help manufacture complex and precise products.</p>
