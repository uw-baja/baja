			<h2>About</h2>

				<h3>The competition</h3>
				<p>Each team is provided a 10 HP Briggs and Stratton engine and a competition rulebook to which they must comply. Other than these constraints, the team is left free to design every other component of the vehicle.</p>

				<h3>Unparalleled learning experience</h3>
				<p>Our purpose is to provide all of our members with hands-on experience and real world engineering knowledge that cannot be obtained in the classroom alone.</p>
				<p>Fall term marked the start of a new year for the UW Baja SAE Team. Our team is comprised of 26 UW engineering students. Seven 4th year senior members are responsible for the design and optimization of the Baja Car while 19 junior members, assist, get their hands dirty and learn as much as possible about engineering design and real world applications. The focus this year is a re- design of the rear portion of the Car.</p>
				<p>The main advantage of the Baja team is that it enhances a student's classroom learning experience, ultimately augmenting their University Degree. Furthermore students gain exposure to critical project management aspects of engineering, including teamwork, cost control, scheduling, and work breakdown. In addition, Baja also necessitates attributes not taught in the classroom, such as seeking sponsors and responsibility. Students have to design a vehicle subsystem, create a budget for it, manufacture it and ultimately be responsible guarantee its functionality.</p>
